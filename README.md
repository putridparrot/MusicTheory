Xml configuration file for musical theory

Many years back a colleague and I wrote a Windows Pocket PC application for displaying scales and chords on a guitar style fretboard and piano keys.

I thought I'd post the configuration file on github in case it's of use to anyone. As for the application, it's needs to much work at the moment to put on gihub.

Theory.xml includes many scales showing the step intervals between subsequent notes, alternate names are listed. It also includes chords showing the chord construction using intervals as well as optional notes.
